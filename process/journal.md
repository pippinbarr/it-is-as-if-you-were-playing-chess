Release

Sunday, 14 August 2016 

Todos:
* Work on the emotion timing, right now it feels too fast and kind of out of synch
	(But also think about how it will affect the game over stuff.)
* Add a “look here” symbol that plays between moves, moves around, probably an arrow or X

Issues:
* Dragging super fast at beginning leaves arrow faded in
	SEEMS TO HAVE VANISHED? Possible to have both events be null on showGameOver
	No, still possible for both events to be null (co-incided with arrow faded in once)
* Seems to be if you manage to end the game before any emotion?
* Super fast drag to game over leave dashed line unfaded
* Use minimal phaser build

Made quite a lot of progress on this yesterday evening in the end. Have the basic UI and interaction working. Mostly need to insert the underlying chess game(s) and then come up with a way to generate emotional cues at the bottom, most likely through Tracery for some variety with a grammar. Then it’d be done because it just ain’t that complex babe.
